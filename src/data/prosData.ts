      description:
        "Waxing on a monthly basis might cost more than laser hair removal treatments. With flexible payment plans, within 24 months, you will pay the same amount for both laser hair removal and waxing. However, while laser hair removal eliminates the need for treatment after 2 years, waxing requires consistent treatment for 20 or 25 years.",

    //     "Many still speculate the safety of laser hair removal. This treatment was cleared by the FDA in the early 1990s and has grown in popularity since then. It is completely safe and only targets the hair follicle without affecting the surrounding skin or tissue.",
